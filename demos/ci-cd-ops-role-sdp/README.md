## Trello Card Description

OPs Role in the Software Delivery Process
==================================

Our CI/CD Pipeline demo tells the story from the Developers' point of view. However, Ops teams should also play a part in the software delivery process.

1. Enhance existing Material
---------------------------------

- Enhance the CI/CD Demo materials we have to show how Dev code and Ops code are merged in the build pipeline
  - Ops code should be in the form of app server configs and build instructions (.sti) in a separate Git repo.
  - OpenShiftâ€™s build process would bring the two together (post Jenkins)

2. Enhance Presenters and Implementer's Guide
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Enhance/Create a Presenter Guide and Implementation guide for making this happen?

*Notes:* Some Points of Emphasis
  - Show how Ops teams would "control" the configs and builder images
